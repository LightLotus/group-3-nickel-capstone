                  "Leah Gotti is a wonderful trainer. She is so sweet and captivating to watch with her dogs.
                   Her videos are professional and she teaches each new trick or command in a step-by-step
                   fashion that makes them easy to follow. I have taken two of her courses now and am hoping
                    to take another in the near future. Thank you so much!"

                  Kieth and Charming Pets are an absolute treasure! The positive reinforcement 
                  approach is ALWAYS the way to go, and  Kieth explains WHY his methods work 
                  so well in a way that actually makes sense! I learned a lot of this in school, 
                  but the way information is presented in this course makes it more applicable to
                  daily life and super easy to follow!."
